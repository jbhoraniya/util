Helm is 'package' manager for Kubernetes.  

Helps with following "bare" Kubernetes issues:  
1. Maintaining Kubernetes YAML files is tedious (a lot of in-yaml duplication, a lot of duplicated YAMLs for multiple environments)
2. Allows to express dependencies, surprisingly Kubernetes doesn't support this
